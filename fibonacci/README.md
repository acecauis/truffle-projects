# Truffle Tutorial on Debugger Variable Inspection

New functionality to make your contract more *powerful* -- you now have the ability to perform *variable inspection on your contracts*

  By having _variable inspection ability_, you can *know* the *exact state* of your *variables at every given point in* the *instruction list*,
  giving you much greater ability to truly inhabit the current state of your contracts and _making debugging much easier_.

## Creating and Inspecting Simple Solidity Contract Using the Truffle Solidity Debugger

### Basic Smart Contract
#### Making a fibonacci sequence:

What is a fibonacci sequence?
  The fibonacci sequence is an integer sequence where each successive number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers.

  With the first two numbers set to 1, you can determine every number in the sequence through iteration.

Generating the Fibonacci sequence with a smart contract can show off the debugger and its variable inspection without getting too bogged down in details.
